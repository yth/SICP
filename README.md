# SICP
Working through SICP as a means to start programming language studies.

On hiatus and will only be worked on occassionally until January 2019

## Additional Resources:

### SICP Supplement Site:
http://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html

It has sample projects and teaching recommendations.

### Adventures in Advanced Symbolic Programming
https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/

Additional Projects and reading material.

As a prerequisite, it mentions 6.034 (an MIT AI Course). The open courseware
version is at:

https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-034-artificial-intelligence-fall-2010/assignments/

I really liked the first lecture. It might be interesting to go through part of
this course using Scheme (lisp), which was developed in part for AI research.

Some resources for the AI course:

### More Books and Resources

Some directly related to SICP and Scheme, and others are for exploring more
programming languages, or study programming languages as a subject. It's listed
in no particular order.
