# Section 1.1 Notes

Languages help us manipulate ideas. There might exist a collection of primitive
ideas [primitive is used in the sense that they are not based on something else
from the perspective of the language][1]. Any complex idea can be build up from primitive ideas by means of
combination. We can manipulate complex ideas like primitive ideas by means of
abstraction.

Programming languages are no different. Any powerful language need to have a set
of primitive expressions. It needs to have ways for its user to combine
primitive expressions into complex expressions. Ideally, it would also need to
have ways to let its users to use and manipulate complex expressions as if they
were primitive expressions.



'(' and ')' combines the list of expressions within them into more a more 
complicated expression. This is an example of combination.
