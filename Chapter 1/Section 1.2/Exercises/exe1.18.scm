; This has the same general solution as 1.16.
;
; This exercise is skipped at this reading.
;
; In essence, this is helps you create an algorithm for integer operations
; that's O(log(n)). In addition, doubling and halving can use shift
; operations, which is more efficient.
;
; This would be a useful exercise to complete in the future.
